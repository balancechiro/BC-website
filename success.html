					<p class="p">I came to Dr. Yang's office for chiropractic treatment because I was in a great deal of pain after I was involved in an accident.  I had lower back pain when I came in.  I had been on medication-muscle relaxants and other pain killers and they made me sluggish and groggy.  I couldn't do what I wanted to do on a day-to-day basis because I was constantly sleepy.  The medication was not helping me very much and it was impairing my everyday function.  Also, I believe medications have a lot of side effects, so I did not want to continue taking them.  I was in major pain and my body was feeling seized up and not working with me, so I came and spoke to Dr. Yang.  She did her examination and proceeded to provide me with a treatment plan.  That has helped a lot.  I can feel a difference in my mobility and I don't take as long to get out of bed in the morning.  It's a very pleasant environment here and I definitely recommend Dr. Yang's services to people I know.  It's been very helpful to me and it's not invasive.  I'm feeling a great deal better.  Thank you, Dr. Yang.</p>

					<p class="p">I've had severe low back pain for the past 2 years.  It was a sharp pain that started after giving birth to my first child and then it only increased with the birth of my second child.  I finally decided to see a chiropractor and found Dr. Yang online.  Since coming here, my back pain has improved greatly.  I was having pain every day and now it's less than once every 2 weeks and the severity has decreased, which is so much better.  I'm able to do a lot more than I used to and I have better range of motion.  I like coming here because Dr. Yang takes care of every issue that I have, such as my hips and arms.  She is very nice and I definitely would recommend her services to people with any pain.  She takes care of you. </p>

					<p class="p">Ever since high school, my back has been in a lot of pain from carrying books and purses.  I developed a slight scoliosis and now that I'm in college, I have to carry even more books.  Also, due to stress, I was constantly in pain.  I would ask my family to massage my back or I would lie flat on the ground to give myself relief.  Other times, I would go to sleep early to avoid the pain.  </p>
					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p">When I came to Balance Chiropractic, Dr. Yang examined my back and told me what the problems were.  I'm really glad I came because there were a lot of things I didn't know about my back that she showed me.  My lower back no longer hurts and I love coming here because every time I come in, I receive so much relief once I've been adjusted.  I feel great and can go home and concentrate on my schoolwork without pain.  Also, I've gained so much knowledge about my back and what I need to do that would best work for my body.</p>
					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p">The treatment Dr. Yang gives is amazing and I don't feel any pain when she adjusts me.  The office is really nice and it's not intimidating or scary, but I'm able to talk about how my back is because the people are here to help me.  It feels like I'm in a place where they really want to help me.  Dr. Yang has really made me feel comfortable and welcome here at Balance Chiropractic. </p>
					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p">I would definitely recommend Dr. Yang to anyone experiencing any type of pain at all, whether it be their back or anywhere else.  It's been really great coming in here and I've made a lot of progress in the short time I've been here.  I've learned so much and have received so much relief.  I'm making so much progress.  Dr. Yang is great and I definitely recommend her.  You can talk to her about anything. </p>

					<p class="p">I'm a 59 year-old male and I've suffered for 30 years with lower back and upper back problems, especially in the shoulders.  I was previously diagnosed with arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and tendonitis and was treated with no results.  Remarkably, after just one treatment with Dr. Yang, I found relief.  I've received approximately six treatments and the mobility in my upper back, arms, and shoulders has improved dramatically.  I strongly suggest that you find treatment through Chiropractic.  With Chiropractic, I found great results.</p>

					<p class="p">After a fall, I had a problem with my back and left knee. I could hardly walk at that time and my back was just killing me.  I felt so terrible.  I couldn't sit or stand or anything.  I tried to take pain pills and rest, but it really didn't do much and I was so sore.  Connie Reeves referred me to Dr. Yang and she helped me so much.  I'm so improved and now I'm able to walk, stand, move, and bend over to touch my toes so much more than I was able to before.  Dr. Yang is just so sweet and calm and I really like the way she treats me.  Her office is cool and not on the warm stuffy side.  I definitely would recommend her to others and I thank her very much for helping me. </p>

					<p class="p">I went to Balance Chiropractic because I had a lower back problem and my shoulder was hurting me.  I had constant pain around my neck and shoulder area and had difficulty sleeping.  I also used to get a pins & needles sensation when I woke up in the morning and moved in a certain direction.  I tried to ignore the pain and did stretches, exercises, and used Icy Hot and warm showers for my back.  </p>
					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p">I sought treatment at Balance Chiropractic because my lower back was causing me problems.  When I walked for 20 to 30 minutes, my lower back would bother me and I couldn't take it anymore.</p>
					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p">I went in to Balance Chiropractic for an examination and decided to start receiving treatment.  Dr. Yang's treatment has helped out tremendously.  Previously, when I finished playing basketball, my back would be killing me.  Now I can actually play basketball and walk for longer lengths of time without pain.</p>
					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p">What I like about Dr. Yang is that she is very intelligent and knows what she's doing.  She has given me exercises that I can do daily while I'm at home and at work.  She's very knowledgeable about the muscles and the back.  Also, she is very gentle.</p>
					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p">I would recommend Balance Chiropractic to anyone.  Dr. Yang has done a magnificent job of taking care of my back.  I would just like to say thank you, Dr. Yang, and I'm glad I met you at the street fair or my back would still be having problems.</p>

					<p class="p">As a college student, I fell and hurt my back.  This lower back pain was aggravated by pregnancy and carrying my large baby boy.  The constant bending and lifting caused pain to radiate down my lower back.  I felt tired and had to cut back on everyday activities like my walks through the park and any chore that involved bending.  Because I was experiencing back pain, I was overcompensating in other areas of my body and soon I was tense, stiff, and achy all over.  I did not want to continue the cycle of medications because that was treating the symptoms and not the cause. </p>
					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p">I saw Dr. Yang at the Monrovia Farmers Market and liked her personable approach and knowledge.  Dr. Yang immediately pin-pointed the pain area in my back and also throughout my shoulders and neck area.  Through her gentle manipulations, I've been able to gain mobility in my back and neck.  I seldom wake up stiff.  Also, Dr. Yang taught me how to be more aware of my body and specific stretches I could do at home to prevent any future stiffness.  I would definitely recommend Dr. Yang to others who are suffering from pain and stiffness.</p>

					<p class="p">The condition that caused me to seek treatment at Balance Chiropractic was pain and stiffness in my neck and shoulders.  I was constantly trying to get rid of the pain by stretching, but it wasn't working.  To relieve my symptoms, I tried physical therapy and went to my primary doctor and neither of them helped.  One gave me stretches to do and the other prescribed muscle relaxants, but that wasn't sufficient.  Dr. Yang's treatment of periodic adjustments has helped me by removing the discomfort in my back and relaxing my back and neck, taking out the stiffness.  Now I don't experience pain as much when I'm at work or going about my general life.  I like Dr. Yang because she is very thorough with her treatment and I feel very comfortable and trust her judgment in my care.  I like her general bedside manner.  I have recommended Balance Chiropractic to others and will continue to do so.  Thank you, Dr. Yang, for your care.</p>

					<p class="p">I went to Balance Chiropractic because I had a lower back problem and my shoulder was hurting me.  I had constant pain around my neck and shoulder area and had difficulty sleeping.  I also used to get a pins & needles sensation when I woke up in the morning and moved in a certain direction.  I tried to ignore the pain and did stretches, exercises, and used Icy Hot and warm showers for my back.  </p>
					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p">Dr. Yang's treatment has helped me tremendously.  I don't have lower back problems anymore and I don't feel the stiffness, pain, or pins & needles sensation.  The scar tissue in my neck and shoulders are breaking up.  I can rotate my neck, shoulders, and arms and have more freedom to move around. </p>
					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p">The improvement is clear.  I can sleep better at night.  When I go to bed, I don't have to struggle with positioning myself to alleviate the pain.  I have a deeper sleep as a result and don't wake up in the middle of the night.  The best thing for me so far is being able to sleep the whole night through.</p>
					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p">The office is clean and professional.  Dr. Yang is a very friendly person and is always welcoming and in good spirits.  She is willing to listen.  During the report of findings, she told me about my condition through what she found during the exam and x-rays.  That was important for me.  She didn't just recommend treatment, she gave her reasons why and asked me questions.  I think it is key for the patient to know that what the doctor is doing or saying is being relayed back to the patient.</p>
					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p">I have recommended Balance Chiropractic to family members.  There's no doubt about it, it's helped me and I definitely feel a difference for the better.  The anxiety I felt because of the pain has been lifted.</p>

					<p class="p">Prior to my treatment at Balance Chiropractic with Dr. Yang, I had stiffness and felt the extreme need for chiropractic alternative treatment.  The stiffness interfered with my daily living and I just felt that I was not in alignment.  </p>
					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p">I sought treatment with Dr. Yang to help relieve some of my symptoms.  She has helped me considerably.  I've been coming now for two months and I see a definite improvement.  Connie Reeves, my massage therapist, referred me to Dr. Yang.  Between the two of them, I feel 100% better.  I will continue to follow Dr. Yang's instructions and keep my appointments with her. </p>

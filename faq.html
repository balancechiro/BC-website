					<h1 class="h1">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="p2">Q: What is the Vertebral Subluxation Complex?</p>
			<p class="p">A: The Vertebral Subluxation Complex (VSC) has five parts that describe the malfunction of the nervous system, muscles, soft tissues, the spine and the rest on the body due to abnormal position and motion of spinal bones. The detection, treatment and prevention of VSC make Chiropractic unique in the health care sciences.</p>
					<ol>
					<li class="oi">Kinesiopathology - the loss of normal vertebral positioning and motion in relation to neighboring vertebrae  </li>
					<li class="oi"> Myopathology - pathological changes occurring in the spinal musculature which includes hypertonicity, spasming, fibrosis, weakness and improper or inappropriate functioning  </li>
					<li class="oi">Neuropathology - irritation or injury to spinal nerve roots through compression, stretch or more commonly chemical irritation from nearby spinal structures </li>
					<li class="oi">Histopathology - pathological changes which occur to the spinal tissues such as abnormal bony growths off the vertebral bodies and joints, fibrosis and adhesions of spinal muscles and ligaments, as well as dehydration and degeneration of spinal discs </li>
					<li class="oi">Pathophysiology - the biochemical changes taking place in the spinal region which include inflammatory biochemicals from injured tissues and biochemical waste products </li>
					</ol>
					<p class="p2">Q: Does everyone get subluxations?</p>
			<p class="p">A: Yes. Spinal malfunction is a common health problem due to trauma, stress, long periods of sitting, poor posture, improper sleep habits and many other activities. Most often the only way to eliminate the VSC is by specific spinal adjustments to restore biomechanical function and remove nervous system interference.</p>
			<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="p2">Q: What is an adjustment?</p>
			<p class="p">A: A specific Chiropractic procedure using carefully directed and controlled pressure to restore spinal bones to their normal position and motion. Normalizing the position and motion of spinal bones eliminates the VSC and allows the body to begin the healing process. </p>
			<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="p2">Q: Will insurance cover my Chiropractic care?</p>
			<p class="p">A: Most insurance carriers recognize Chiropractic care for at least the early part of care. Most insurance policies are designed to help with catastrophic health problems or only when obvious symptoms are present. Insurance coverage will likely end before full spinal rehabilitation has occurred. Yet the VSC is a much too serious threat to your health to be dependent upon insurance as to whether or not you receive proper care. </p>
			<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="p2">Q. How long does it take to start feeling better?</p>
			<p class="p">A: Children respond very quickly. Adults take longer because most spinal problems are the result of years of neglect. As with any healing process, every person's progress is slightly different. Your personal lifestyle, diet, exercises and regularly keeping your appointments all affect your progress.  </p>
			<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="p2">Q: Is pain always associated with improper spinal function?</p>
			<p class="p">A: No. Your body is very adaptive and pain is seldom associated with the early occurrence of the VSC. When pain is present, many times it will diminish or disappear even if corrective action isn't taken, emerging months or years later as a far worse condition. </p>
			<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="p2">Q: Does Chiropractic work for all types of health problems?</p>
			<p class="p">A: No. However Chiropractic care is successful with a very wide variety of health problems not necessarily considered "back" problems because of improved nervous system function. With a more normal nerve supply the body's natural healing capacity can improve a variety of health problems. </p>
			<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="p2">Q: Will I have to see a Chiropractor for the rest of my life? </p>
			<p class="p">A: That's up to you. Most patients want to maintain their progress and help keep the problem from returning and find regular care helpful. Other patients look to chiropractic for help only when they have obvious symptoms. Whatever your goal, we're here to support your decision. </p>
			<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="p2">Q. Why do I need to keep coming back so often?</p>
			<p class="p">A: Retraining the muscles that support your spine and maintain the proper position and motion of individual vertebrae can be a time-consuming process. Since Chiropractors cannot rely on braces to move spinal bones like orthodontists use to reposition teeth, repeated adjustments over time are necessary.  </p>
			<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="p2">Q: Should you be adjusted if you're pregnant?</p>
			<p class="p">A: Anytime is a good time for a better functioning nervous system. Pregnant mothers find Chiropractic adjustments improve their pregnancy and make delivery easier for themselves and their baby. Adjusting methods are always adapted to a patient's size, weight and condition. </p>
			<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="p2">Q: What is the sound I hear when the doctor adjusts my spine?</p>
			<p class="p">A: It is the sound of fluid and soft tissue moving in the spinal joint as it returns to its normal position. It often sounds much louder to you because sound travels so easily up the spinal column to your ears. Not all adjustments create this sound, so the effectiveness of an adjustment should not be judged by the presence or loudness of the sound.  </p>

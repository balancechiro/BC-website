					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p">Once the doctor has identified your problem, she will begin care for your condition.  This may include adjustments, physiotherapy, and soft tissue therapies.  An adjustment, as Doctors of Chiropractic use the term, means the specific manipulation of vertebrae, which have abnormal movement patterns or fail to function normally. This misalignment is called a subluxation. Doctors of Chiropractic spend years learning motion palpation (the art of examining by movement or touch) and other forms of spinal examining procedures, so that they can administer specific and appropriate spinal adjustments.  Once the doctor has identified your problem, she will begin care by way of these adjustments. Particular attention will be paid to that area of your spine where a subluxation has been detected. The adjustment is usually given by hand, and consists of applying pressure to the areas of the spine that are out of alignment or that do not move properly within their normal range of motion. Doctors of Chiropractic use many sophisticated and varied techniques, and the specific procedure to be used will be determined and explained completely to you following a careful evaluation of your physical findings. </p>
					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
					<h1 class="h1">At Balance Chiropractic there are three main stages to chiropractic care:</h1>
					<ol>
					<li class="oi">Many patients start seeing a chiropractor during the Relief stage, where they are looking for acute pain management. The goal of this phase is to have you feel better as quickly and completely as possible. </li>
					<li class="oi"> In the Corrective stage, the doctor will treat the underlying causes that create an imbalance, discomfort, or pain. Chiropractic care at this stage will facilitate the body's natural ability to heal and stabilize itself. A large percentage of healing takes place during this phase.  </li>
					<li class="oi">Once you are in the Maintenance stage of care, chiropractic will maintain the progress you have achieved, support ongoing healing and to help prevent future health problems. Your treatment plan becomes largely about staying well rather than getting well. We have patients who continue to come in once per week for active maintenance. We also have patients who come in once every two or three weeks, once a month, or only when they are in acute pain. </li>
					</ol>
					<h1 class="h1">Home Instructions</h1>
					<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p">After the adjustment, the doctor will give you further instructions on what you can do at home to help implement your health goals. The best results are achieved when you take an active role in your own health by following your at-home care plan. Please remember to make sure you schedule about an hour for this first visit. We look forward to helping you achieve optimal health at Balance Chiropractic!</p>
